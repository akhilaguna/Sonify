# Sonify - Personalized Music Recommendation Based on Weather Conditions

Sonify is a web application that provides personalized music recommendations by integrating weather data to curate mood-based playlists. The app leverages various APIs to deliver a unique listening experience by suggesting Spotify playlists based on the current weather in the user's location. With Sonify, music is no longer just a personal preferenceâ€”it's influenced by the environment.

## Features

- **Spotify Integration**: Users can log in with their Spotify accounts and listen to recommended playlists directly through the app.
- **Weather-Based Music Recommendations**: Utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and suggest playlists that match the mood likely invoked by the current weather.
- **Mood Analysis**: Uses the OpenAI API to analyze weather data and predict the mood associated with it, then fetches Spotify playlists that suit that mood.
- **Location-Based Personalization**: Retrieves the user's current location to provide localized weather data and music recommendations.
- **Spotify Web Playback SDK Integration**: Allows for seamless playback of the recommended music within the app, maintaining a smooth user experience.

## How It Works

1. **User Login**: The user logs in via their Spotify account, granting access to their music library and playback capabilities.
2. **Location Retrieval**: The app fetches the user's current location to gather local weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
3. **Weather Data Processing**: The fetched weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, weather conditions) is sent to the custom OpenAI assistant.
4. **Mood Determination**: The OpenAI assistant processes the weather data and returns a mood classification (e.g., "chill," "energetic," "melancholic").
5. **Playlist Recommendation**: Based on the determined mood, the app uses Spotify's search endpoint to find playlists that match the mood and minimizes chances of recommending the same playlist to multiple users simultaneously.
6. **Music Playback**: The recommended playlist is played using the Spotify Web Playback SDK integrated within the app.
